# GENERAL INFORMATION
This is the Unity project used in the user study (baseline condition) presented in a CHI2024 paper ''On the Benefits of Image-Schematic Metaphors when Designing Mixed Reality Systems".

#FOLDER AND FILES STRUCTURE

The "Baseline"/"ISM-Enhanced" project is streamlined to include only the essential folders required for development and collaboration. Below is an overview of these folders:

A. Assets [Folder]
This folder contains all project-specific assets, including scenes, scripts, materials, textures, and prefabs. This is the primary directory where development work occurs, as it houses the content you create or import for your project.

B. Packages [Folder]
This folder holds all the Unity packages currently used in the project. This includes both Unity's official packages and any third-party packages necessary for the project.

C. ProjectSettings [Folder]
This folder Contains all the configuration files for your project settings. This includes settings for aspects like physics, graphics, input, and player preferences. These settings are global and affect the entire project, ensuring that the project behaves consistently across different environments and platforms.

D. .gitignore [GITIGNORE file]
This file maintains the cleanliness and efficiency of the project repository when using version control systems like Git. The .gitignore file is designed to tell Git which files and directories to ignore when committing changes.

#OPENING AND USING THE PROJECT

To get started with the "Baseline"/"ISM-Enhanced" Unity project, follow these simple steps:

1. Open Unity Hub on your device.

2. Within Unity Hub, press the 'Open' button and navigate to the directory where you store "Baseline"/"ISM-Enhanced". Select the directory to add it to your Projects list in Unity Hub.

3. This project was developed and saved using Unity Editor version 2021.3.15f1. To avoid compatibility issues, please ensure you have this specific version installed before proceeding. Find "Baseline"/"ISM-Enhanced" under the Projects tab in Unity Hub, and click it to open the project in the Unity Editor. If you do not have version 2021.3.15f1 installed, Unity Hub provides options to download and install different versions of the Unity Editor.

4. Once the project is open in the Unity Editor, go to the 'Assets' folder and select the main scene named 'MainScene'. Now you can begin tweaking existing assets or incorporating new elements into this project.
